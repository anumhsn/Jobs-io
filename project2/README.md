## MVP:
- Using the GitHub API, the user can search for available jobs posted on GitHub and narrow that search by specifying the location and the type of job.
- The app will contain a search bar where input can be taken about parameters, and a button will show the resulting jobs on the page 

## PostMVP 
- A "heart" next to each job posting will save that specific job to a page called "my jobs", where the user can store their favorites 

## React Component Hierarchy
- Home component 
    - Header component
    - Search bar component
    - Main component where jobs are rendered
    - Footer
